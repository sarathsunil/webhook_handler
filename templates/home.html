                <h4>Release Notes Policy</h4>
                <p>There will be one release note per project per release</p>
                <p>However this does not mean that the release note generated will be final, as more and more issues are added to this release, the release note will be revised to include these</p>
 
                <h4>When do we update Release Notes for a release</h4>
                <p>Release Notes are generated whenever there is a push to the repo which results in a successful build</p>
 
                <h4>Pre-requisites for autogeneration of Release Notes</h4>
                <p>The release notes will not be generated if the last commit message does not match the format JIRA ISSUE ID:comment. Example commit message: "CSIDO-10:New modules added" </p>
                <p>The release notes will not be generated if the corresponding  JIRA ITEM does not have a valid release tag in the release tag field of JIRA</p>
                <p>The release notes will not be generated if the ISSUE-ID is already in Done state in JIRA</p>
            </div>

                <h4>Regenerate Release Notes</h4>
                <p>If you find that one of your releases did not get a release note, you can have the release notes regenerated by mentioning the project name and release tag</p>
 
                <h4>Lookup Release Notes</h4>
                <p>In case if you want to see the release notes generated for a particular project and release tag, you can look it up using this option</p>
 
                <h4>Get Release Note in PDF</h4>
                <p>Please enter a valid project name and release tag to download a PDF copy of the generated release notes</p>
